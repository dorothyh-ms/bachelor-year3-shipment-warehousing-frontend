This repository contains a Vite+React+Typescript frontend application used to communicate with the shipment-warehousing backend. 

This repository is part of a project for a fictious minerals warehousing firm, which processes incoming shipments of minerals via landside deliveries, monitors warehouse capacities, and processes outgoing shipments via waterside vessels.
